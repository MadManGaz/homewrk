My homework needs somehwere to live

## Note from years later
This is some homework from the first year I really learned how to program in a foundation degree CS course. Just interesting to me looking at myself as a total beginner, not sure how much I've learned from my mistakes haha, hopefully something.

This won't build, missing vcproj files, should be easily fixed though.
